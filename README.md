# Mathematics for Machine Learning

This folder is a compilation of my programming assignments (PA) for the Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera. Below descriptions of each assignment

1. Backpropagation - implementation of feedforward network

2. Fitting the distribution of heights - using Jacobians to find the steepest descent

3. Gram-Schmidt Process - implementation of the Gram-Schmidt procedure for finding an orthonormal basis for a list of vectors.

4. Identifying Special Matrices - testing for singular matrices

5. PCA_Week1_PA - means and covariances of datasets

6. PCA_Week2_PA - vector operations and K Nearest Neighbors

7. PCA_Week3_PA - orthogonal projections of matrices, eigenfaces, and linear regression

8. PCA_Week4_PA - implementation of Principal Component Analysis

9. Page Rank - implementation of the Page Rank algorithm

10. Reflecting Bear - exercise in change of basis vectors
